# Task 3: Vulnerability Assessment 

## Overview

This task focuses on conducting a **vulnerability assessment** of a personal Windows system using industry-standard tools. It aims to provide real-world exposure to identifying, analyzing, and documenting security risks through an automated scan using **Nessus Essentials**.

**Tools**: OpenVAS Community Edition (free vulnerability scanner) or Nessus Essentials.
**Deliverables**: Vulnerability scan report with identified issues.

This exercise simulates the initial steps of professional risk assessment and builds familiarity with CVEs, CVSS scores, and vulnerability mitigation techniques.

---

## Objective

- Install and configure a vulnerability scanner.
- Scan the local system for known vulnerabilities.
- Analyze the findings based on severity and type.
- Document observations and remediation strategies.
- Develop an introductory understanding of system hardening.

## Summary of Findings

| Severity | Total Issues | Vulnerabilities                          |
|----------|--------------|------------------------------------------|
| Medium   | 4            | SMB Signing not required                 |
| Low      | 10+          | Missing Headers, Deprecated Services     |

> All vulnerability descriptions were cross-referenced with [NIST NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/) and CVSS scoring methodology.

## Remediation Strategy

### Medium & Low:
- Enforce message signing in the host's configuration. On Windows, this is found in the policy setting 'Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (always)'. On Samba, the setting is called 'server signing'. See the 'see also' links for further details.
- Purchase or generate a proper SSL certificate for this service.

---

## Key Takeaways

- Gained practical exposure to Nessus and automated scanning techniques.
- Learned to interpret vulnerability metadata: **Plugin ID**, **CVE ID**, **CVSS**, and **solution references**.
- Differentiated between vulnerability scanning and manual penetration testing.
- Understood the role of periodic scans in maintaining system hygiene.
- Experienced hands-on remediation planning based on technical documentation.
